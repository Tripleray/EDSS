                <h2>Environmental Decision Support System for Floating Treatment Wetlands</h2>
                <p>Floating treatment wetlands are a technology that has had a slow incorporation into mainstream application, however many companies have begun recognizing the effectiveness of the technology at treating water quality issues.  For example, New Zealand is currently incorporating this technology into water quality treatment in many different municipalities around the country. One such company, WaterClean, is using the technology in the treatment of fishing rivers, tertiary stormwater treatment, and even to control fluctuating water levels.3 This technology is an extremely good representation of how traditional landscaping can be taken from simple aesthetics to high functioning environmental remediation, however the science behind it is much more complex. Nutrient removal and reductions in ammonia, total nitrogen, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), and habitat enhancement are factors that this technology has the capability to improve in the environment. A case study performed in Montana by Floating Island International showed that instituting FTWs into a wastewater lagoon decreased total phosphorous levels through the stacked consumption of periphyton by minnows, and minnows by panfish. This triple layered feeding chain allows for the transformation of organic phosphorous into the form of a harvestable resource that reduces the total organic phosphorus level in the water, reducing algae blooms, and can be used as food for the fourth level of the feeding chain: humans. Bruce Kania says this in regards to the prior mentioned case study, “Ultimately, the floating streambed created a more efficient system that produced a more diverse ecosystem in regards to vegetation, insects, minnows, and invertebrates.”2

                        <p>Joel Kaminski's motto is, "to leave a place better than how it was found is how I make my world go round."This saying has helped him connect with brilliant people all over the globe, allowing him to grow his community that he hopes one day will support his ideas to connect people to each other, and new exciting technologies that can help build a brighter tomorrow, togerher. This has always been his passion, and It all started with winning the 2012 First Technical Challenge (FTC) robotics world championships against China with the robot Joel built with his team. This accomplishment helped spur on new and crazy ideas like learning how to build islands from trash to help clean the ocean and house the homeless, or socially stressed; and allowed him to realize the natural leader within himself. Going to college and learning how to build islands, test hypothesis with statistical analysis, and much more Joel graduated with a B.S. in Integrated Science and Engineering: Environmental focus (ISAT) from James Madison University in the spring of 2017. His internship with Floating Island International during his last summer in college (2016) opened his eyes to the growing freshwater issues plaguing the developed, and developing worlds. So Joel's mission is "clean water, for all" and with teamwork, determination, and a touch of wisdom it can become reality. Now Joel looks towards new heights  and opportunities to help himself grow as a person and connect with individuals that support his goals. If we can work together anything can be done.
