                <h2>Environmental Decision Support System for Floating Treatment Wetlands</h2>
                <p>Floating treatment wetlands are a technology that has had a slow incorporation into mainstream application, however many companies have begun recognizing the effectiveness of the technology at treating water quality issues.  For example, New Zealand is currently incorporating this technology into water quality treatment in many different municipalities around the country. One such company, WaterClean, is using the technology in the treatment of fishing rivers, tertiary stormwater treatment, and even to control fluctuating water levels.3 This technology is an extremely good representation of how traditional landscaping can be taken from simple aesthetics to high functioning environmental remediation, however the science behind it is much more complex. Nutrient removal and reductions in ammonia, total nitrogen, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), and habitat enhancement are factors that this technology has the capability to improve in the environment. A case study performed in Montana by Floating Island International showed that instituting FTWs into a wastewater lagoon decreased total phosphorous levels through the stacked consumption of periphyton by minnows, and minnows by panfish. This triple layered feeding chain allows for the transformation of organic phosphorous into the form of a harvestable resource that reduces the total organic phosphorus level in the water, reducing algae blooms, and can be used as food for the fourth level of the feeding chain: humans. Bruce Kania says this in regards to the prior mentioned case study, “Ultimately, the floating streambed created a more efficient system that produced a more diverse ecosystem in regards to vegetation, insects, minnows, and invertebrates.”2
